# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis
This project presents an interactive Hospital Emergency Room Analytics Dashboard built using Power bi  
The dashboard helps analyze patient flow, waiting times, and visit trends to support operational and decision-making insights in a healthcare environment.

Why I Built This
While working with the hospital dataset, I wanted to:
Analyze how many patients come in each day, See how long they wait, Find peak hours and busy patterns
Use time intelligence (like calendar tables) to make daily/monthly comparisons
This dashboard also helped me learn more about modeling data, writing DAX formulas, and building a user-friendly report.

What’s Inside
Here’s what the dashboard includes:
Total patients count and other key metrics
Average waiting time
Hourly wait time groups
Interactive date slicers
Cross-filtering visuals and clean layout
It uses a Calendar table to drive all date-based visuals and make the analysis easy to navigate.

This report includes 4 Pages:

Tech Used
Power BI Desktop
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Power Query for data shaping
Model relationships and time intelligence features.

Key takeways from this Report:
Patient inflow and waiting time vary by hour and day.
Peak hours show higher waiting times.
The dashboard helps identify busy periods and support better staffing decisions.
